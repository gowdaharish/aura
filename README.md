This is an app which mainly used by me to learn and experiment various things.

Roughly there are three main categories to the projects
1. Audio
2. Video
3. Image

Each of them will have set of features which can be adjusted in realtime to see the effects.
This project is considered for the Camera calibration and Object detection projects.

This is heavily under process still. Various functionalities are yet to be finalized.
